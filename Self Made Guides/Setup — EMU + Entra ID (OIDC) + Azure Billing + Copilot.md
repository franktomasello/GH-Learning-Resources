# 🚀 GHEC EMU Enterprise Setup Runbook (OIDC)

> **Complete end-to-end guide for configuring EMU with Microsoft Entra ID (OIDC), Azure billing, and GitHub Copilot**

---

## 📋 Overview

**Scope:**

- **Identity:** Microsoft Entra ID (OIDC) for SSO
- **Provisioning:** SCIM (Automatic User Provisioning)
- **Billing:** Azure Subscription (Metered)
- **Copilot:** Business/Enterprise (Enable & Assign via Teams or Enterprise Teams)

---

## 0️⃣ Prerequisites (Critical)

### People & Permissions

| Role | Required Permissions |
|------|---------------------|
| **GitHub** | Access to the setup user (`@SHORT-CODE_admin`) email to set the initial password |
| **Microsoft Entra ID** | A **Global Administrator** to consent to the "GitHub Enterprise Managed User (OIDC)" app during SSO setup |
| **Azure Billing** | A user who can provide **tenant-wide admin consent** AND has **Owner** rights on the target Azure Subscription |

> ⚠️ **Important:** Being an Entra Global Admin alone is **not sufficient** for the billing step. You must also have Owner permissions on the specific Azure Subscription resource.

### Hosting Location

| Environment | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **GitHub.com** | Standard cloud hosting |
| **GHE.com** | Data Residency (dedicated subdomain) |

This affects your SCIM Tenant URL format in Step 4.

### Before You Begin Checklist

- [ ] Setup user invitation email received
- [ ] Access to Microsoft Entra admin center
- [ ] Azure subscription ID ready
- [ ] Secure password manager for storing recovery codes and tokens

---

## 1️⃣ Create/Secure the EMU Setup User

*The setup user (`@SHORT-CODE_admin`) is the only local account that can bypass SSO in emergencies.*

### Steps

1. Open the "setup user invite" email in a **private/incognito browser window**
2. Set a strong password (store in secure vault)
3. **Immediately enable 2FA:**
   - Navigate to: Profile picture → **Settings** → **Password and authentication**
   - Configure a TOTP app (recommended) or other 2FA method
   - Download and securely store your **personal 2FA recovery codes**
4. Store credentials in a secure company vault (e.g., 1Password, LastPass, Azure Key Vault)

> ⚠️ **Critical (January 2025 Change):** All subsequent logins for the setup user require either a successful 2FA challenge OR use of an enterprise recovery code. If you do not save your enterprise recovery codes (generated in Step 3), you will be locked out.

> 📝 **Note:** If you ever need to reset the setup user password, you must contact [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/). The standard email-based password reset does not work for setup users.

---

## 2️⃣ Create the SCIM Token

*This token allows Microsoft Entra ID to provision users to GitHub via SCIM.*

### Navigation (GitHub)

```
Profile Picture → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic) → Generate new token (classic)
```

### Token Configuration

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Note** | `SCIM Token for Entra ID` (or similar) |
| **Expiration** | **No expiration** ⚠️ If this expires, provisioning stops entirely |
| **Scopes** | Select **only** `scim:enterprise` |

1. Click **Generate token**
2. **Copy the token immediately** — you cannot view it again

> 📝 **Store this token securely.** You will need it when configuring provisioning in Microsoft Entra ID (Step 4).

---

## 3️⃣ Enable Microsoft Entra ID OIDC SSO

*Connects identity so users can authenticate via your IdP.*

### Navigation (GitHub)

```
Profile Picture → Your enterprises → Select enterprise → Identity provider tab → Single sign-on configuration
```

### Steps

1. Under "OIDC single sign-on", select **Enable OIDC configuration**
2. Click **Save** — you will be redirected to Microsoft

### In Microsoft Entra ID (during redirect)

3. Sign in as a user with **Global Administrator** rights
4. Review the permissions requested for "GitHub Enterprise Managed Users with OIDC"
5. ✅ Check **"Consent on behalf of your organization"**
6. Click **Accept**

### Back in GitHub

7. **Save your Enterprise Recovery Codes:**
   - Click **Download**, **Print**, or **Copy**
   - Store these securely — they are separate from your personal 2FA codes
   - These codes allow emergency access if your IdP becomes unavailable
8. Click **Enable OIDC Authentication**

> ✅ **Verification:** After completing this step, the setup user can still access the enterprise using their local credentials, but all other users will authenticate via Entra ID.

---

## 4️⃣ Configure SCIM Provisioning

*Pushes users and groups from Microsoft Entra ID to GitHub automatically.*

### 4A) Determine Your Tenant URL

| Hosting | Tenant URL Format |
|---------|-------------------|
| **GitHub.com** | `https://api.github.com/scim/v2/enterprises/{enterprise-slug}` |
| **GHE.com** | `https://api.{subdomain}.ghe.com/scim/v2/enterprises/{subdomain}` |

> 💡 **Example:** If your enterprise URL is `https://github.com/enterprises/acme-corp`, your Tenant URL is `https://api.github.com/scim/v2/enterprises/acme-corp`

### 4B) Configure Microsoft Entra ID

1. Go to [entra.microsoft.com](https://entra.microsoft.com/) → **Enterprise applications**
2. Select **GitHub Enterprise Managed User (OIDC)** (created automatically during Step 3)
3. Click the **Provisioning** tab → **Get started**
4. Set **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**
5. Under **Admin Credentials**:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Tenant URL** | Your URL from Step 4A |
| **Secret Token** | The PAT created in Step 2 |

6. Click **Test Connection** — must show success ✅
7. Click **Save**

### 4C) Configure Provisioning Settings

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Scope** | Sync only assigned users and groups |
| **Provisioning Status** | **On** |

Click **Save**

### 4D) Assign Users and Groups

1. Go to **Users and groups** tab in the Entra application
2. Click **Add user/group**
3. Add a test user or pilot group
4. For users who need Enterprise Owner role, set the **Role** attribute accordingly

### 4E) Initial Sync

| Method | Timing |
|--------|--------|
| **Automatic** | Wait ~40 minutes for the initial sync cycle |
| **Manual testing** | Use **Provision on demand** to test individual users immediately |

> ⚠️ **Important:** The combination of Okta and Entra ID for SSO and SCIM (in either order) is explicitly **not supported**.

---

## 5️⃣ Create Organization(s) Inside the Enterprise

*EMU enterprises cannot invite or import existing organizations — you must create them fresh.*

### Navigation

```
Profile Picture → Your enterprises → Select enterprise → Organizations tab → New organization
```

### Steps

1. Enter organization name (e.g., `acme-engineering`, `acme-platform`)
2. Click **Create organization**

> 💡 **Best Practice:** Plan your organization structure before creating. Consider separating by business unit, product line, or team function.

---

## 6️⃣ Connect Entra ID Groups to GitHub Teams

*This is the "Golden Path" for automated permissions management.*

### Navigation

```
Profile Picture → Your organizations → Select organization → Teams tab → New team
```

### Configuration

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Team name** | e.g., `developers`, `platform-engineers` |
| **Description** | Optional but recommended |
| **Identity Provider Groups** | Select the synced Entra group from dropdown |

Click **Create team**

### Important Constraints

> ⚠️ **No Nested Teams:** When a team is linked to an IdP group, you cannot nest it under other teams.

> ⚠️ **Nested Groups in Entra:** Microsoft Entra ID does not support provisioning nested groups. Only direct members sync.

---

## 7️⃣ Connect Azure Subscription (Billing)

*Required for metered billing: Copilot, Actions minutes, Packages storage, GHAS, and Codespaces.*

### Prerequisites Check

- [ ] Tenant-wide admin consent capability in Azure
- [ ] Owner permissions on the target Azure Subscription

### Navigation

```
Enterprise Settings → Billing & Licensing → Payment information → Metered billing via Azure → Add Azure Subscription
```

### Azure Connection Flow

1. Sign in with your Microsoft account
2. Review the **"Permissions requested"** prompt
3. Click **Accept**
4. Under **"Select a subscription"**, choose the Azure Subscription ID
5. Check the confirmation box
6. Click **Connect**

> ⚠️ **Troubleshooting:** If you see "You need admin approval" instead of the permissions prompt, work with your Azure AD Global Administrator to grant consent or configure an [admin consent workflow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-admin-consent-workflow).

### Verification

- ✅ Azure Subscription ID appears under "Payment information"
- ✅ You can now enable metered services like Copilot and GHAS

---

## 8️⃣ Enable Copilot & Assign Seats

*Two methods available: Organization Teams (traditional) or Enterprise Teams (public preview)*

### Phase A: Enable Copilot at Enterprise Level

**Navigation:**
```
Enterprise Settings → Policies → Copilot
```

**Configuration:**

| Policy | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| **Access to Copilot** | Enabled (or allowed for specific organizations) |
| **Suggestions matching public code** | Consult legal counsel |
| **Copilot Chat** | Enable for full functionality |
| **Copilot in the CLI** | Enable as needed |

Click **Save**

> ⚠️ **Important:** If this policy is not enabled, you cannot assign Copilot seats at the organization level.

### Phase B: Assign Seats

#### Option 1: Via Organization Teams (Traditional Method)

**Navigation:**
```
Organization → Settings → Copilot → Access
```

1. Click **Allow this organization to assign seats**
2. Click **Start adding seats**
3. Select **Purchase for selected members**
4. Select the team created in Step 6
5. Click **Continue to purchase** → **Purchase seats**

#### Option 2: Via Enterprise Teams (Public Preview)

*Allows assigning Copilot licenses at the enterprise level, without requiring organization membership.*

**Navigation:**
```
Enterprise Settings → People → Enterprise teams → [Create/Select team]
Enterprise Settings → Billing & Licensing → Licensing → Copilot Business → Add seats → Add enterprise teams
```

> 💡 **When to use Enterprise Teams:**
> - Users who need Copilot but not full GitHub Enterprise Cloud licenses
> - Simplified management for large enterprises
> - Direct IdP group synchronization at enterprise level

### Result (Zero-Touch Provisioning)

When configured correctly:
1. User is added to Entra ID group
2. SCIM automatically provisions their GitHub account
3. User is automatically added to the linked GitHub Team
4. Copilot license is automatically assigned via Team membership
5. User can immediately use Copilot in their IDE

---

## 9️⃣ Validation Checklist

Run through these checks to confirm successful setup:

| Check | How to Verify | Expected Result |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| **OIDC SSO** | Have a provisioned user attempt to sign in | Redirects to Entra ID, successfully authenticates |
| **SCIM Provisioning** | Check Enterprise → People tab | Test users appear with `_shortcode` suffix |
| **Group Sync** | Check Organization → Teams | IdP group members appear in linked team |
| **Azure Billing** | Enterprise → Billing & Licensing → Payment information | Azure Subscription ID displayed |
| **Copilot Access** | User opens VS Code with GitHub Copilot extension | Copilot icon active, suggestions working |

### Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| Issue | Common Cause | Solution |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| Users not provisioning | SCIM token expired or invalid | Regenerate PAT with `scim:enterprise` scope |
| SSO redirect fails | Entra app misconfigured | Verify OIDC app settings in Entra admin center |
| "Admin approval required" for Azure | Insufficient Azure AD permissions | Request tenant-wide admin consent |
| Copilot not activating | Policy not enabled at enterprise level | Enable in Enterprise → Policies → Copilot |
| Team membership not syncing | Nested groups in Entra | Flatten group structure or add users directly |
