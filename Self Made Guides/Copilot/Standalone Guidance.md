# 🚀 Copilot Standalone Guidance

> **How to assign Copilot Business licenses without consuming GitHub Enterprise (GHE) licenses**

---

## 📋 Overview

Assign Copilot Business licenses to ~1,000 users **without consuming GitHub Enterprise (GHE) licenses**.

---

## 🔧 Phase 1: The Setup (Critical Configuration)

### Step 1: Navigate to Enterprise Settings

1. Click your profile photo (top-right) → **Your enterprises**
2. Select the target enterprise

### Step 2: Create the Enterprise Team (The "Zero-Cost" Step)

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: This step determines if you pay for 1,000 extra GHE licenses or not. Follow exactly.

1. Go to **People** → **Enterprise teams**
2. Click **Create enterprise team**
3. **Name:** Use a functional name (e.g., `copilot-standalone-users`, `contractor-devs`)
4. **Organizations:** **LEAVE THIS BLANK**

#### 🛑 WARNING: Organization Access
- **DO NOT** select any organization
- **Why?** If you grant this team access to an organization (even "Read" access), every user in it becomes a "standard enterprise member" and immediately consumes a full GitHub Enterprise license (approx. $21/mo or $231/yr depending on contract)
- **Correct State:** The team exists at the *enterprise* level only, with no org affiliation

---

## 👥 Phase 2: Add Users to the Team

Choose the method that matches your infrastructure.

### Option A: IdP Group Sync (Best for Long-Term/EMU)

*Requires Enterprise Managed Users (EMU) or Team Sync configured.*

1. In your IdP (Okta, Azure AD, etc.), create a group (e.g., `github-copilot-users`)
2. In GitHub **Enterprise teams**, select your team (`copilot-standalone-users`)
3. Go to **Settings** → **Identity Provider Groups**
4. Connect the IdP group
   - **Constraint:** The GitHub team must have **no manually assigned users** before you link the group
   - **Result:** Membership is now 100% automated by your IdP

### Option B: Scripted REST API (Best for Bulk Initial Setup)

*Use this if you have a CSV of usernames and don't use IdP sync.*

**Correct Endpoint:**
```
PUT /enterprises/{enterprise}/teams/{enterprise-team}/memberships/{username}
```

**Bulk Add Option (Recommended for 1,000 users):**
```
POST /enterprises/{enterprise}/teams/{enterprise-team}/memberships/add
```
*(accepts an array of usernames)*

**Important Note:** Enterprise team slugs receive an `ent:` prefix. Use the full slug format in API calls.

**Logic:**
1. Read list of usernames
2. Loop through list: Call endpoint for each user (or use bulk add)
3. Handle 404s (user not found) or 422s (already member)

### Option C: Manual UI (Not Recommended)

- Valid only for <50 users
- Do not attempt for 1,000 users

---

## 📜 Phase 3: Assign the License

1. In the Enterprise account, go to **Billing & licensing**
2. Select **Licensing** → **Copilot**
3. Click **Manage** (next to Copilot Business)
4. Switch to the **Enterprise teams** tab (not the default "Organizations" tab)
5. Click **Assign licenses**
6. Select your team (`copilot-standalone-users`) and confirm

### ✅ Outcome
- **All 1,000 users now have a Copilot Business license**
- **Cost:** 1,000 × Copilot Business rate
- **GHE Seat Consumption:** 0 (Verified)

---

## ✓ Phase 4: Verification & Limits (Triple-Checked)

| Check | Verified Fact |
|:------|:--------------|
| **Team Capacity** | **5,000 Members.** The limit was increased from 500 to 5,000 per enterprise team in December 2025. |
| **License Consumption** | **Copilot Only.** Users in an enterprise team *without* org access do NOT consume a GHE/Visual Studio license. |
| **Billing Deduplication** | **Unique User.** If a user is already licensed for Copilot in an Org, adding them here generally does not double-bill; the system bills per unique user based on GitHub's combined billing model. |
| **Scope** | **Copilot Business Only.** This method does *not* grant Copilot Enterprise features (which require repo context/org access). |
| **Feature Status** | **Public Preview.** Enterprise Teams remain in Public Preview, though widely stable for this use case. |

## ⚠️ Common Pitfall to Avoid

### The "Upgrade" Trap

If you later decide to upgrade these users to **Copilot Enterprise** (to use Chat with your codebase), you will need to grant them access to repositories.

- **The Moment you do this:** You must add them to an Organization
- **The Cost:** They will immediately consume a **GitHub Enterprise license** + the **Copilot Enterprise upgrade** cost
- **Conclusion:** Keep them on **Copilot Business** if the goal is "standalone" usage (IDE completion/chat without repo context)

## ❓ Common Questions & Troubleshooting

### Q: Users in the enterprise team are consuming GHE licenses — what went wrong?
**A:** The enterprise team was likely granted access to an organization. If the team has any org affiliation (even "Read" access), every member becomes a standard enterprise member and consumes a GHE license. Verify the team has no organization access under Enterprise > People > Enterprise teams > [your team] > Settings.

---

### Q: We want to upgrade standalone users to Copilot Enterprise — what's the cost impact?
**A:** Copilot Enterprise features require repository and org access. The moment you add standalone users to an organization, they consume a GitHub Enterprise license (approximately $21/month) in addition to the Copilot Enterprise upgrade cost. This is the "upgrade trap" — factor in the GHE seat cost before migrating.

---

### Q: Can we use IdP group sync and manual assignment together on the same enterprise team?
**A:** No. If you link an IdP group to an enterprise team, the team must have no manually assigned users. Membership becomes 100% automated by your IdP. Choose one method: IdP sync for long-term management or API/manual for initial setup.

---

### Q: We hit the enterprise team member limit — what's the cap?
**A:** The limit is 5,000 members per enterprise team (increased from 500 in December 2025). If you need to assign Copilot to more than 5,000 users in standalone mode, create multiple enterprise teams and assign licenses to each.

---

### Q: A user already has Copilot through an org — will adding them to the standalone enterprise team cause double billing?
**A:** No. GitHub's combined billing model bills per unique user. If a user is already licensed for Copilot in an org, adding them to the enterprise team generally does not double-bill. The system deduplicates based on unique user identity.
